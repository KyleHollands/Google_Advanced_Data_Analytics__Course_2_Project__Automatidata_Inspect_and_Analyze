# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Project â€“ Course 2

## Project Overview
The goal of Project Course 2 was to develop a PACE Strategy Document, conduct an initial analysis of the dataset, summarize the results, and present findings to stakeholders in an Executive Summary.  

Automatidata has been contracted by the New York City TLC to build a regression model capable of forecasting taxi fares based on trip distance. A preliminary examination of the data was conducted to describe important variables and ensure actionable insights could be derived.

## Data Understanding
The dataset was analyzed to identify anomalies and determine the most useful variables for developing a predictive model. Key variables identified include:  
- **Trip Distance**  
- **Total Amount (Fare Amount)**  

Potential correlations between these two variables were explored, laying the groundwork for further EDA, visualizations, and modeling.

## Analysis and Evaluation
A thorough exploratory analysis of the data was performed, including:  
- Cleaning and reformatting the dataset as required  
- Identifying outliers and determining appropriate actions (removal or further investigation)  
- Generating descriptive statistics, summaries, and tables to better understand key variables  

Anomalous data points were observed, including:  
- Low trip distance with high fare amounts  
- Trip distance = 0 with nonzero fare amounts  
- Negative or extremely high values  

## Conclusion
Key variables (trip_distance and fare_amount) were identified for building a regression model to predict taxi fares. Addressing anomalies and understanding the distribution of these variables prepares the dataset for reliable modeling and accurate fare forecasts.
